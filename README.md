### Overview

The New Music Release Radar app will automate the process of discovering and organizing new music released in the past six days by artists the user follows. The app will have features for viewing songs and albums, creating and managing playlists, and more. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan to bring this application to life.

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

1. **User Stories**:
   - As a user, I want to view a list of songs released in the past six days by artists I follow.
   - As a user, I want to view a grid of albums released in the past six days.
   - As a user, I want to save playlists with a click.
   - As a user, I want to add new songs to my playlists.

2. **Key Features**:
   - User authentication and integration with a music streaming service API (e.g., Spotify).
   - Display of recently released songs and albums.
   - Playlist creation and management.
   - UI/UX design for an intuitive user experience.

### Phase 2: Technology Stack

1. **Front-end**:
